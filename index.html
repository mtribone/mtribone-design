            <p>One person web machine. I specialize in responsive design, web accessibility, and user interfaces. HTML and CSS are my building blocks. I like to start with a good document outline and design the experiences from there using your brand guidelines or ones that we create together.</p>
          <p>Research builds good user experiences. I'll start with a discovery phase which we will refine together that will yield a better understanding of your business, your goals, and your target. Next, we'll define the scope, schedule, milestones, resources, and user flow. Then we'll put together some wireframes, style boards, and mockups to flesh out the objectives, user experience, and brand. When developing the web site or application, we'll move the resources from the definition phase into HTML and CSS mockups for final approval. Once approved, we'll populate the web site or application with content and visuals.</p>

          <h2 class="home-headers">About Michael Tribone</h2>
            <p>I am a web designer and developer with a fine arts background. I have been designing and developing animations, videos, web sites, and web applications in higher education and as a freelancer for 20 years before opening the studio. Happily married to my spouse for 20 years and currently tripping over a cat and a huskimo regularly. Music, art, cooking food, logging miles with my huskimo is my fuel. My spouse is my rock.</p>
              <p>Opening the studio has been a long-time dream of mine. I am looking forward to collaborating with others on their web projects, illustrations, and user interfaces. I am interested in solving design challenges where I can connect people with people or people with services that break user experiences out of the canned web environment. Templates, stock photos, stock illustrations, modular code, frameworks, etc. all have their place, but we need to use these resources in creative ways. Or we could create your vision from scratch.</p>
            <p>Either way, I'm open to listening to you describe your next big idea.</p>
