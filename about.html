          <h2>The studio</h2>
          <p>One person web design machine. I specialize in responsive design, web accessibility, and user interfaces. HTML and CSS are my building blocks.</p>

          <h2>The process</h2>
          <p><a id="about-studio"></a>Research builds good user experiences. I'll start with a discovery phase which we will refine together that will yield a better understanding of your business, your goals, and your target. Next, we'll define the scope, schedule, milestones, resources, and user flow. Then we'll put together some wireframes, style boards, and mockups to flesh out the objectives, user experience, and brand.</p>

          <p>When developing the web site or application, we'll move the resources from the definition phase into HTML and CSS mockups for final approval. Once approved, we'll populate the web site or application with content and visuals.</p>

        <div class="about-michael">
          <h2>Michael Tribone</h2>
          <p><a id="about-me"></a>I am a web designer and developer with a fine arts background. I have been designing and developing web sites and web applications in higher education and as a freelancer for 20 years. I am experienced in the balance of art and functionality because my early art career, functional ceramics, was steeped in making useful products.</p>
          
          <p>Opening the studio has been a long-time dream of mine. I am looking forward to collaborating with others on their web projects, illustrations, and user interfaces. I am interested in solving design challenges where I can connect people with information and services that break user experiences out of the canned web environment. Templates, stock photos, stock illustrations, modular code, frameworks, etc. all have their place, but we need to use these resources in creative ways. Or we can create your vision from scratch.</p>

          <p>Either way, I'm open to listening to you describe your next big idea.</p>
